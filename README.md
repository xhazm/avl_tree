# avl_tree
Implementation of an AVL tree in CPP.

Supports:
- Insert
- Delete
- Search
- Clear
- Different Lookup Methods (lower/upper_bound)
- Bidirectional Iterator
- Self implemented compare and allocator can be given
- Written in orthodox canonical class form

This tree was written to be used in a first draft of the cpp98 map container.

The AVL tree got replaced by a red black tree, to be found in the ft_containers project on this github.

Not performance optimized, just to get a good picture of Binary Search Trees in general.
